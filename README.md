# Riglet: A DAW-less USB Host/Router

I took up EDM music creation in the summer of 2025 with the goal of using portable devices I could take anywhere. This led me down the road with a few vendors, but I eventually settled on a handful of devices I really like. 

The first challenge I ran into was that my MIDI keyboard did not draw enough power from my USB power bank to stay on. This meant I would likely need to purchase a USB hub and power both the keyboard and charge the groovebox. I would still need a TRS cable for MIDI as well. Then I bought a drum machine—one more USB cable, one more MIDI cable.  

Many of these portable devices support USB-MIDI, but they are generally designed to connect to a computer acting as the host. While this setup would reduce cables, it went against my goal of maintaining a **hyper-mobile, DAW-less setup**.  

There are other MIDI host devices on the market, but they are still primarily TRS-cable oriented with only one USB port.

## What is the Riglet?

The Riglet is a MIDI host with the key difference of having **USB as the primary MIDI transit medium**.  

### Benefits
- Single cable for power and MIDI connectivity  
- Compact size  
- Maintains DAW-less design goals  

---

## Build Components

My initial Riglet build uses the following parts:  
- Raspberry Pi Zero 2W  
- Waveshare USB Hub HAT  

The Riglet could just as easily be built with a standard Raspberry Pi 2B+ (or better), since those have built-in USB ports and audio connections.
